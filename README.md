# teslamonitor
The purpose of this monitor is to keep track and capture insights, in real time, of the most relevant events around Tesla. 

For the past months, I have been working on collecting stock price events, social media events, momentum events, ... in real time, to be able to initiate this stage of the project. 

In this monitor, we'll try to analyze and extract knowledge from the different events, which can help in assessing the current state of the company and making decisions about it.
