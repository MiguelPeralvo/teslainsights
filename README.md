# TESLAMONITOR
The purpose of this project is to keep track and capture insights, in real time, of the most relevant events around Tesla. 

For the past months, I have been working on collecting stock price events, social media events, momentum events, ... in real time, to be able to initiate this stage of the project. 

In this project, we'll try to analyze and extract knowledge from the different events, which can help in assessing the current state of the company and making decisions about it.

The current priority is to develop and deploy different artefacts that perform real time inference, are reasonably stable and that can recover from most exceptions. Once we have a reasonably stable platform, which covers most of the functionality, we'll work on making it production-ready.
