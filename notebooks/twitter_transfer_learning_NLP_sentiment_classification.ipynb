    "# Transfer Learning for NLP: Sentiment Analysis on Twitter\n",
    "This notebook has used the \"Transfer Learning in NLP\" Feedlys' [notebook](https://github.com/feedly/ml-demos/blob/master/source/TransferLearningNLP.ipynb) described in this [article](https://blog.feedly.com/transfer-learning-in-nlp) as starting point.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we show how transfer learning can be applied to detecting the sentiment of twitter posts related to Tesla, between bulls and bears.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook uses the work from [Howard and Ruder, Ulmfit](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1801.06146.pdf).\n",
    "The idea of the paper (and it implementation explained in the [fast.ai deep learning course](http://course.fast.ai/lessons/lesson10.html)) is to learn a language model trained on a very large dataset, e.g. a Wikipedia dump. The intuition is that if a model is able to predict the next word at each word, it means it has learnt something about the structure of the language we are using.\n",
    "\n",
    "[Word2vec](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1310.4546.pdf) and the likes have lead to huge improvements on various NLP tasks. This could be seen as a first step to transfer learning, where the pre-trained word vectors correspond to a transfer of the embedding layer.\n",
    "The ambition of [Ulmfit](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1801.06146.pdf) (and others like [ELMO](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1802.05365.pdf) or the [Transformer language model](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/openai-assets/research-covers/language-unsupervised/language_understanding_paper.pdf) recently introduced) is to progressively move the NLP field to the state where Computer Vision has risen thanks to the ImageNet challenge. Thanks to the ImageNet chalenge, today it is easy to download a model pre-trained on massive dataset of images, remove the last layer and replace it by a classifier or a regressor depending on the interest. \n",
    "\n",
    "With Ulmfit, the goal is for everyone to be able to use a pre-trained language model and use it a backbone which we can use along with a classifier and a regressor. The game-changing apect of transfer learning is that we are no longer limited by the size of trzining data! With only a fraction of the data size that was necessary before, we can trtain a classifier/regressor and have very good result with few labelled data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Given that labelled text data are difficult to get, in comparison with unlabelled text data which is almost infinite, transfer learning is likely to change radically the field of NLP, and help lead to a maturity state closer to computyer vision.\n",
    "\n",
    "The architecture for the language model used in ULMFit is the [AWD-LSTM language model](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1708.02182.pdf) by Merity.\n",
    "\n",
    "While we are using this language model for this experiment, we keep an eye open to a recently proposed character language model with [Contextual String Embedings](http://alanakbik.github.io/papers/coling2018.pdf) by Akbik."

    "- Fine-tune the language model on the amaxon reviews texts\n",

    "# What training size do we need?\n",
    "The language model has already learnt a lot about the syntax. It is very knowledgeable about the context in which words appear in sentences. However, the language model does not contain any notion of [meaning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meaning_%28linguistics%29). This problem is well summarised in [Emily Bender's tweet](https://twitter.com/emilymbender/status/1024042044035985408) during a very interesting twiter thread that occur in July around meaning in NLP. A cool summary of this thread can be found in the [Hugging Face](https://medium.com/huggingface/learning-meaning-in-natural-language-processing-the-semantics-mega-thread-9c0332dfe28e) blogpost. Hence the meaning in language is very likely to be learned through supervision, with the help of ground-truth examples.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, when we perform some NLP tasks, sentiment analysis in our example, both syntax and meaning are important!\n",
    "The idea is that you can save a lot of time by being taught with a lot of blind synatx first, and then learning meaning. Think of when you start learning a complete new field. Well, it is far easier to learn it in your mother tongue than in another language you master less. \n",
    "\n",
    "The big practical gain here is that once you \"know\" a language, you need less supervised examples to learn a new thing! In our example, it means we need less labeled reviews for us to learn a relevant classifier.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's verify this hypothesis by training a classifier with several training size and see how this size affects the performance!"
